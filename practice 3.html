	<h3>how Novels are writen</h3>
	Light novels rely heavily on dialogue, so look at quotes from the characters, 
	and get a feel for the characters' speaking styles. However, keep in mind what<br> 
	kind of audience you want your book to appeal to. 
	If your audience is Western, don't spend your whole time writing just dialogue and no description.
	
	The term "light novel" is a wasei-eigo, or a Japanese term formed from words in the English language.<br> Light novels are often called ranobe or, in English, LN.
	A	distinguishing characteristic of light novels is that 
	they are illustrated with an anime or manga art style and are often adapted into such media.
	
	Character Visuals: Contrary to what you may think, Light Novels do have pictures.
	Both on the cover and in thtoe form of several splash-page illustrations dotting each volume.However, <br>
	in most cases this only happens after all the "novel material" got used up (see also "plot").<p>
